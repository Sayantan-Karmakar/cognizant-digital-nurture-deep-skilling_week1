Importance of Data Structures and Algorithms:

Efficient data storage and retrieval are crucial in inventory management because:

Volume of Data: Warehouses often handle a large volume of products, making it essential to choose data structures that can efficiently handle such large datasets.
Performance: Operations like searching, updating, and deleting products need to be performed quickly to ensure smooth operations and avoid delays.
Scalability: The system should be able to scale with growing inventory without significant performance degradation.
Suitable Data Structures:

Arrays/List (e.g., ArrayList):

Pros: Simple to implement; suitable for scenarios where the number of products is relatively small or fixed.
Cons: Operations like search and update can be slow (O(n)) because they might require iterating through the entire list.
HashMap (Dictionary/Hash Table):

Pros: Provides average-case constant time complexity (O(1)) for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations due to its underlying hash table structure.
Cons: Higher memory usage due to hashing; performance can degrade if hash collisions are frequent.
Balanced Trees (e.g., TreeMap/SortedDict):

Pros: Provides logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)) for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations and keeps elements sorted.
Cons: More complex to implement and can have slower operations compared to hash tables.
