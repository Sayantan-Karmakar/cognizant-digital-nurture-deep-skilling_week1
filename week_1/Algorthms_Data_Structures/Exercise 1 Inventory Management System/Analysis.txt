Time Complexity:

Add Product:

HashMap: O(1) average case, O(n) worst case due to hash collisions.
Array/List: O(n) due to the need to check for duplicates and find the correct position.
Update Product:

HashMap: O(1) average case for lookup and update.
Array/List: O(n) for search and update.
Delete Product:

HashMap: O(1) average case for lookup and deletion.
Array/List: O(n) for search and deletion.
Optimization Considerations:

HashMap Optimization:

Use a good hash function to reduce collisions.
Resize the hash table as needed to maintain efficient operations.
Memory Usage:

Be mindful of the trade-off between time complexity and memory usage. HashMap uses more memory due to its underlying hash table.
Alternative Data Structures:

For very large datasets or specific needs (e.g., sorted data), consider using balanced trees or other specialized data structures.
