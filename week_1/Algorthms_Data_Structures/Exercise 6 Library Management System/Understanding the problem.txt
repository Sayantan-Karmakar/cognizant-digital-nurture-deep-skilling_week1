Understand Search Algorithms
Linear Search:

Algorithm:

Iterate through each element of the list sequentially.
Compare each element with the target value.
If a match is found, return the index of the element.
If the end of the list is reached without finding the target, return an indication that the target is not present.
Time Complexity:

Best Case: O(1) (if the target is at the beginning).
Worst Case: O(n) (if the target is at the end or not present).
Average Case: O(n) due to the need to potentially examine every element.
Binary Search:

Algorithm:

Requires a sorted list.
Start by comparing the target value with the middle element of the list.
If the target is equal to the middle element, return its index.
If the target is less than the middle element, repeat the search on the left half of the list.
If the target is greater than the middle element, repeat the search on the right half of the list.
Continue until the target is found or the search interval is empty.
Time Complexity:

Best Case: O(1) (if the target is at the middle of the list).
Worst Case: O(log n) (search interval is halved each iteration).
Average Case: O(log n) due to halving the search space each step.
