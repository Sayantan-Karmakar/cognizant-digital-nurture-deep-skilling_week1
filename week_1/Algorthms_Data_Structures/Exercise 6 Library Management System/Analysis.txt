Analysis
Time Complexity Comparison:

Linear Search:

Best Case: O(1) (if the book is the first in the list).
Worst Case: O(n) (if the book is at the end or not present).
Average Case: O(n) due to potentially having to examine every book.
Binary Search:

Best Case: O(1) (if the book is at the middle of the list).
Worst Case: O(log n) (as the search space is halved each time).
Average Case: O(log n) due to halving the search space each iteration.
