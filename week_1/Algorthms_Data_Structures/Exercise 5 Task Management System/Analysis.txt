Time Complexity:

Add Task:

Best Case: O(1) (if adding at the head of an empty list).
Worst Case: O(n) (if adding at the end of a non-empty list).
Average Case: O(n) due to traversal needed to find the end of the list.
Search Task:

Best Case: O(1) (if the task is at the head of the list).
Worst Case: O(n) (if the task is at the end or not present).
Average Case: O(n) due to linear search.
Traverse Tasks:

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of tasks.
Delete Task:

Best Case: O(1) (if deleting the head of the list).
Worst Case: O(n) (if deleting a task that is not at the head).
Average Case: O(n) due to linear search and potentially shifting nodes.
