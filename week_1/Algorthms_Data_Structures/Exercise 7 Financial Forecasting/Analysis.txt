Analysis
Time Complexity of the Recursive Algorithm:

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of periods.
This is because the function calls itself n times, each time with a reduced number of periods.
Optimization:

Memoization: To avoid excessive computation, especially for large n, you can use memoization to store results of sub-problems to avoid redundant calculations. Memoization can convert the time complexity from O(n) to O(1) for each sub-problem.
