Future Value Calculation Using Recursion:

We want to calculate the future value of an investment given a growth rate over a number of periods. The future value can be defined recursively as:

Future Value
(𝑛)=Current Value×(1+Growth Rate)𝑛Future Value(n)=Current Value×(1+Growth Rate) n
 

Here, n is the number of periods.
