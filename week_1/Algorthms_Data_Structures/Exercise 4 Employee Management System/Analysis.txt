Analysis
Time Complexity:

Add Employee:

Best Case: O(1) (if there is space in the array).
Worst Case: O(n) (if the array needs to be resized).
Average Case: O(1) if the array does not need resizing.
Search Employee:

Best Case: O(1) (if the employee is at the start of the array).
Worst Case: O(n) (if the employee is at the end or not present).
Average Case: O(n) due to linear search.
Traverse Employees:

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of employees.
Delete Employee:

Best Case: O(1) (if the employee is at the end of the array).
Worst Case: O(n) (if the employee is at the start and requires shifting all subsequent elements).
Average Case: O(n) due to linear search and shifting.
