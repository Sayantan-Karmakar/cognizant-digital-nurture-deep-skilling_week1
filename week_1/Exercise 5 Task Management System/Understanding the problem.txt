Understand Linked Lists
Types of Linked Lists:

Singly Linked List:

Structure: Each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.
Traversal: You can only traverse in one direction, from the head to the tail.
Operations: Easy to implement insertion and deletion operations at the head or tail, but deletion in the middle requires traversal from the head.
Doubly Linked List:

Structure: Each node contains data, a reference to the next node, and a reference to the previous node.
Traversal: Allows traversal in both directions, forward and backward.
Operations: More complex due to the need to maintain two references, but it allows more efficient insertion and deletion operations at both ends of the list and from the middle.
